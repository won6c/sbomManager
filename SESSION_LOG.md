Session 1
Architecture Finalized: All CLAUDE.md files synchronized with risk-aware asset scope (Kernel, Binaries, Daemons, 3P, Ports, Permissions) and user-driven status workflow. Tech stack approved. Core module implemented and validated. Project ready for Plugin/Data layer execution.
### 2026-05-05 14:22 - Daemon Probe Implementation
- Implemented DaemonProbe with hybrid systemd/psutil approach.
- Added robust binary path resolution to avoid garbage characters (e.g., '{').
- Implemented non-root graceful degradation with PRIVILEGE_RESTRICTED markers.
- Verified with tests/verify_daemons.py (Passed).
- Handled environment where psutil returns PID=None for sockets.
### 2026-05-05 14:24 - Kernel Probe Implementation
- Implemented KernelProbe for version detection and security config extraction.
- Implemented keyword-based filtering (KASLR, SMEP, SMAP, etc.) to reduce noise.
- Implemented non-root graceful degradation with PRIVILEGE_RESTRICTED markers.
- Verified with tests/verify_kernel.py (Passed).
- Handled missing /proc/config.gz and /boot/config- files gracefully.
